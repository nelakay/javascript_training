Html (Hyper Text Markup Language)
HTML is used for User Interface (UI) in web applications. 
Web applications: are applications which work using internet. 

What is internet?
It's a collection of computers connected toghether. In order for them to connect together, they need a protoccol (this is a set of rules to be followed in communication)

The HTTP is the protocol used by the internet. Hypertext Transfer Protocol. 

To identify humans, we use names. To identify computers that are connected through the internet, we use IP addresses (Internet Protocol). 

Domain names were created to remember IP addresses, so that it becomes easier to remember and use them. e.g. www.google.com
This is called a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) or Domain. 

In communication, domain names are converted to IP addresses

The www is implicit, and does not have to be written out. 

Domain names have to be purchased and then mapped to the server. 

URL can be used on Browsers. Browser is a program which understands HTTP protocols. This means it can be used for communication. 
The server is giving a response to an HTTP request. 

Two types of systems: client & servers

Client is a machine that can send requests. 

Server is a machine that can process the request and give a response. 

What is a server? Server is a computer that is more powerfull than personal computers. They have more RAM, more computational power, etc. 

HTML is important because our browsers use and understand HTML to display the UI. 

HTML is a tag based language. 

<html> each tag will perform a particular function. 

b tag will display in bold
i tag will display in italic
u tag will display with an underline
We can combine tags to make sentences bold and italic, or bold and underlined, etc. 
br tag will break the line to the next one. 

Heading tags are used to order items in the browser and give visual hirarchy. 

Abbreviations are there to indicate an instruction or explanation displayed on hover. 

We have two types of lists (ordered and unordered). They have list items within them and can be nested. 

Image tag has many attributes like src which indicates the image to be included. It has further attributes like width and height. Also, alternate text (alt) which will be displayed in case the image can not be downloaded and showed on the screen. 

Table tag is used to create a table in html. HTML tables consists of rows and columns. Rows is represented by <tr> tag, while columns are represented by the <td> tag. We can also specify headers using the <th> tag. 

Rowspan is basically used for sharing the cell between two rows.
